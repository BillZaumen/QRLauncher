Description: Gnome support for QRLauncher icons for Pop OS.
 This package provides the icons for various mime types
 specific to QRLauncher. The GUI for Pop OS does not find
 icons in /usr/share/icons/hicolor, so for that case the
 icons have to be in /usr/share/icons/Pop. This installion
 will fail if the icons are already installed and owned by
 a different package.  The dependency on pop-icon-theme is
 intended to prevent this package from being installed on
 systems that do not use the Pop OS icons.
