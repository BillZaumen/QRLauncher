Description: Utility that opens URLs in QR codes contained in images.
 The image formats supported are those that Java recognizes, and there
 is expected to be one QR code per image. The default browser will be used
 to handle a URL's contents, provided that the Java implementation and
 the desktop support that capability. One can provide the image files on
 the command line or drag and drop, or copy and paste, the images files
 into this application.
