qrlauncher (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the -m option to set the width and height of each 'square'
    in a QR code to either a specified value.  If the -m, -w, and -h
    options are missing, the software will try to create as small a
    readable QR code as feasible. Especially for SVG, the way the
    QR code is written was changed in an attempt to create smaller files.

qrlauncher (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the --binary option and changed the handling of font sizes
    so that, if no font size is explicitly provided or if the font size
    is zero, an appropriate size will be computed based on the label (which
    must be present) and image dimensions.

qrlauncher (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

    codes include the image height and width, and the error-correction
    level.
