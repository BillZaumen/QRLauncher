<BR>
<P>
  QRLauncher is a simple utility that can both read and generate QR
  Codes.  When the command <CODE>qrl</CODE> is run with no arguments,
  or when the corresponding desktop file is left-clicked, a window
  will open. Dragging image files (ones that java recognizes) into
  this window will result in a web browser or other suitable program
  opening the data contained in the QR code.
<P>
  When the command <CODE>qrl -g</CODE> is run, or the desktop action
  for generating QR codes is selected, a dialog box will display a
  table.  The left side of the table contains <EM>properties</EM>
  and the right side contains the corresponding values.  The
  properties are:
  <UL>
    <LI><STRONG>Input.uri</STRONG> or <STRONG>Input.file</STRONG>.
      The first line will contain one of these properties. Unlike
      the others, this property can be edited by selecting the desired
      item from a list that will be displayed when the table cell is clicked.
    <LI><STRONG>Width</STRONG>. The width of the QR code in pixels.
    <LI><STRONG>Height</STRONG>. The height of the QR code in pixels.
    <LI><STRONG>Foreground.color</STRONG>. The color of the QR Code that
      will be generated.
    <LI><STRONG>Background.color</STRONG>. The color of the background
      behind the QR code that will be generated.
    <LI><STRONG>ErrorCorrection.Level</STRONG>. The error-correction level
      for the QR Code. When the value is clicked, a list of choices will
      be displayed: <STRONG>L</STRONG> to be able to correct damage to 7%
      of a QR code ,
      <STRONG>M</STRONG> to be able to correct damage to 15% of a QR code.
      <STRONG>Q</STRONG> to be able to correct damage to 25% of a QR code, and
      <STRONG>H</STRONG> to be able to correct damage to 30% of a QR code.
    <LI><STRONG>QRCode.imageFormat</STRONG>. This value, when clicked
      provides a list of the image formats that can be generated. The
      default choice is PNG. Changing the image format will clear the
      value giving the file name.
    <LI><STRONG>QRCode.file</STRONG>. This option, when clicked, opens
      a dialog box for choosing files. The types appropriate for the
      current image format will be shown.
  </UL>
  For the properties <STRONG>Width</STRONG> and <STRONG>Height</STRONG>,
  entering <CODE>$(Height)</CODE> or <CODE>$(Width)</CODE> respectively
  will result in <STRONG>Width</STRONG> and <STRONG>Height</STRONG> having
  the same values.  This can be done for one of these two properties but
  not both.
<P>
  There are a number of command-line arguments and those can be used to
  generate QR codes as well.  These are described in the manual pages
  for <STRONG>qrl</STRONG>. Some are available by using desktop actions.
